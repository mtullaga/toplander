                        There has been much controversy around this hair growth booster, not only among countless celebs in Hollywood, but also in the media. Sales of

                        , which has no recorded side effects in any clinical trials, was soon the target of critics who claim it was too powerful to be sold without a prescription, while other supporters insist that
                         Asami 
                        is a safer and more effective alternative then that of any drug, or procedure currently available on the marketplace.

                    Surveys suggest most balding men go through their life blaming baldness above other physical conditions for their lack of confidence with women; this is one of problems Asami has solved for many of its users.  <em> “Now that I have hair on my head, I’m told I look fifteen years younger and my confidence is back.” Tyrone Cabigas  </em>

                         Asami 
                        , the answer is yes. If you’re looking to halt your hair loss and to regrow your hair,
                         Asami 
                        is one of the proven heavy hitters.

                        ’s ingredients are verified as potent DHT-inhibitors, eliminating hair loss from the source of the problem. The ingredients contained in the supplement have also been shown to increase the bulb size of the hair follicle, which can help hair to appear both fuller and healthier. Users claim that they notice a difference in their hair after they have begun the first regime of the product. Although
                         Asami 
                        is marketed towards men, it also carries the same results among female users.

Blood from the blood vessels in your scalp feed the root, which creates more cells and creates hair growth.

Asami has also been shown to nourish the root and strengthen the hair wires, creating fuller, healthier hair while revitalizing old follicles for rapid growth at the same time.

I waited until today to update this entry because even though 80% of my head is bald, I still do see a barber from time to time to clean up the hair I have left. Let me tell you, the look on my barbers face when I walked in the door…. He was stunned by the amount of new hair growth there was since my last visit. Where it was completely bald before, there was now new 0.6cm hair growth occurring throughout my scalp.

                                    Asami Hair Growth Supplements really work. It takes a few weeks but it has transformed my hair which was definitely thinning on top. My hair is in much better condition now, and thicker overall. Cant wait to see how I look in another month.

Although it is Marketed towards men, a friend of mine told me it works just as well for women. Not only did  Asami   help to stop my hair from falling out, it also regrew it in a matter of weeks! I've been taking the spray for just over 1 month now. It has helped me feel more confident and satisfied with my appearance. The spray is great and easy to take without experiencing side effects."  <br><strong> Josephine Estrada  </strong>

                                <div class="center"><strong> Before And After Pics  <br> I was told about  Asami    by a college friend of mine who had suffered for years with balding and thinning hair. When I saw him at a wedding last year with a full head of hair I had to ask him what he did, I assumed surgery. Wrong! I ordered my first spray on the plane back home and the results speak for themselves. My wife loves it and I feel more confident secure. 3 weeks and I went from balding to balling!!!  <br> Romy Ompoc   <br></strong></div>

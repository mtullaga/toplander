										<p><strong> Makarand Sule </strong>
											<br> Doctor of Medical Sciences, India. Founder of Modern Kinesiotherapy (neurology and orthopedics) - an alternative method of treating chronic diseases and injuries of musculoskeletal system. The main principle of this new method is not taking medicinal drugs or wearing corsets, it's more about a better understanding of your own body and its potential.
											<br> Medical practice: more than 30 years </p>
										<div style="clear: both;"></div>
									</div>
									<p></p>
									<p> This doctor claims that he can cure osteochondrosis which developed during 18 years in a couple of months. That he can cure a very old woman suffering from the most severe case of arthritis in 78 days. As for the joint pains, if treated properly, they will go within 4 days! During 48 years of his practice, he keeps confirming each of his statements by showing how it works in action. Immediately after live broadcast on the chanel 'India-1' (the program on the topic 'how to keep your joints healthy at any age') a well-known doctor Makarand Sule agreed to give us an interview. </p>
									<p><strong> How do you do, Dr. Makarand Sule. Tell me, is the following statement true, that joint diseases and osteochondrosis are inevitable for mature people? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> Hello, Susan. Of course, it is not true. Excessive trust in doctors who strive to cure you for 10 years but never succeed in doing so, that is inevitable for mature people. As a matter of fact, joints, chondrosis and the entire skeletal system can be very well treated at any age. And this is not a miracle but just pure science. </p>
									<p> If you know the secret and put a bit of efforts in terms of self-discipline, you can cure the disease at home very fast, thousands of my patients do that. </p>
									<p><strong> And what is the secret? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> The secret is in understanding why you have pains. Overall there are up to 147 different possible reasons for the development of osteochondrosis and arthrosis listed in medical encyclopedias, but the consequence is one and the same - joints, vertebra and cartilage lose their elasticity, hence the pain. They are worn out because of poor blood circulation. </p>
									<p> That's the whole secret, we cure the joint by restoring its blood supply. </p>
									<p><strong> But isn't it generally conceded that it is almost impossible to restore blood circulation after the age of 45? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> This is complete nonsense. I got myself out of a wheelchair after an injury, and this was more serious that just turning 45. </p>
									<p><strong> Have you saved others from a wheelchair? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> Yes, and more than once. But most of my patients are ordinary people over 40 who developed these diseases as they grew older. They come to me with similar problems: osteochondrosis, arthrosis, radiculitis, pinched nerve. These diseases exhaust you and don't let you live normally. </p>
									<p> People complain of pain, it's hard even to walk. They are just regular citizens, not sporstmen and not disabled. They cry 'Why me? What have I done?' I reply plainly 'let's stop whining and start restoring blood circulation'. </p>
									<p><strong> How do you restore blood circulation at this age? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> Until recently I treated my patients with the help of a complex movement program consisting of 96 exercises which involved trainers. This is an exteremely effective method, but very long and hard.
										<br> It hurts, it is difficult, people don't have time to hit the gym. I believed that there exists an easier and more modern method and I've found it. </p>
									<p><strong> How very interesting! Will you tell our readers about it? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> Sure. Our centre was the first one in India to get a certified access to a brand-new remedy for osteochondrosis and joint pain. I have to admit, when I first learnt about it I just laughed because I didn't believe in its effectiveness. But I was amazed by the results of our tests - 4567 of patients completely got rid of their condition, and that is more than 94% of all subjects. 5.6 felt a significant improvement, and only 0.4$ didn't notice any changes. </p>
									<p><strong> What kind of remedy is it? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> I'm talking about a unique remedy <a href="#"> Arthrazex </a> This balm makes it possible to forget about back and joint pain virtually in no time, no more than 4 days, and cure even the most neglected cases in a couple of months. </p>
									<p> More than 1.3 million dollars was spent on the development of its formula and almost 13 million dollars were paid for the right to distribute this product across the country. </p>
									<p><strong> So does that mean that Arthrazex can be bought only in India? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> At the moment, yes. But starting with January 1st it will be available for all citizens of Europe. </p>
									<p><strong> How does this miraculous balm work? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> There's no miracle, only pure science. The balm Arthrazex consists of 32 powerful components which make weakened old cells function 7 times faster when they get into contact with them, thus the cells gradually rejuvenate. </p>
									<p> Just by one application of the balm on the affected area you will activate more than 930000 cells which will be of good service to your blood flow. This is how this treatment goes. The main thing here is stability. </p>
									<p><strong> Sounds impressive. But we need another explanation, what would it mean for people with ordinary diseases? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> This means that medieval British medicine is finally becoming a thing of the past and you can cure your diseases at home within 1-2 months. The balm Arthrazex has no freezing or anaesthetizing effects, it 'relaunches' the body on a cellular level. It removes the underlying cause of pains and puts joints and spine back in their initial, normal state. A patient not just gets rid of symptoms, but also eliminates the core of the disease - weakened blood flow caused by slow dying cells. </p>
									<p> On the very first day the balm triggers the functioning of the body regenerative systems. It also relieves pain syndrome, which you will feel at once. In 2-3 weeks the treatment will be finished, but keep in mind that you should repeat the course eventually in order to prevent relapse. </p>
									<p><strong> Does the balm <a href="#"> Arthrazex </a> help to cure arthrosis and osteochondrosis exclusively? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> No, that's what I'm trying to make you understand: it acts on a cellular level, restoring your blood flow. It cures any kind of disease related to joints and spine: arthrosis and arthritis, sciatica, rheumatism, radiculitis, herniated vertebra. Injuries, traumas, bruises, fractures, even calloses - the balm is highly effective in all these cases. </p>
									<p><strong> This seems like a very curious remedy. Does it really eliminate all these diseases, not just relieve the pain? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> The balm Arthrazex alleviates pain (at early stages of the treatment) and eventually completely eliminates the disease. Don't get me wrong, I like exercises and sport and I'm not going to quit it, but for most of my patients this balm is the easiest, most effective and available method of treatment. </p>
									<p><strong> I guess many would like to know where you can get it? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> We wanted to begin selling it in the pharmacies, but we don't seem to come to terms with pharmacists, because the balm can spoil their business. People keep buying their medications for years, and there are more and more of those in need of treatment - that's the actual state of affairs that suits pharmacists. </p>
									<p> So now we sell it exclusively on the <a href="#"> official site </a> .
										<br> There are some benefits though - we sell directly, without middlemen, which gives us the chance to lower the price making it 4,7 cheaper than retail price. </p>
									<p> Shipping is conducted by mail, payment upon delivery, this is home treatment so you won't be needing a specialist's observation. However, you shouldn't take my word for it. Try remedies produced by other manufacturers if you want to compare. But I'm sure that you won't find anything even remotely similar to Arthrazex in terms of its effectiveness. </p>
									<p><strong> Thank you, doctor, for the interview! Is there anything you would like to add for our readers before we finish? </strong>
									</p>
									<p> Yes! Yes of course. I would like to call to our readers attention that back and joints diseases get 'younger', i.e. not only old people have it now. Even mild regular pains is the sign which you must not ignore. Your doctor is not going to persuade you to get treated. </p>
									<p> And remember: the diseases triggered by joint and spine pains don't only bring discomfort. They also shorten your lifespan by 10-15 years. </p>
									<p> P.S.: The doctor decided to give Arthrazex to the first 50 buyers at a discount price! Go to <a href="#"> the official site </a> and maybe you will get lucky! </p><span class="author"><i> interviewer Lakshmi Manisha <br> Photos were taken from open sources </i></span>

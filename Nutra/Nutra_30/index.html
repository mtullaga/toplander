										<p> <b>(CL reporter)</b> - Olivia Harris, a student at Cornell University, was able to drop 37lbs off her waist in 1 month without ever using a dime of her own money. Olivia is studying nutrition sciences at Cornell, and for a required research project Olivia thought it would be perfect to use university funds to find out how to 'hack' her weight loss. According to Olivia, "the most expensive piece of it all was actually finding what worked. But the actual solution only cost about $5." </p>
										<p><i>"I had struggled with my weight my whole life. I tried things like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig, which just didn't work as good as they promised. I am a single Mom with a kid at home and I am also working towards my degree, so I don't have any time to be at the gym. When I was assigned this big research project, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to get a deeper look at the natural weight loss opportunities that are out there, and that is when I found out about combining <a href="#">Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia</a> and apple cider vinegar. The best part of it all, I can tell that my daughter is proud of me." - Olivia Harris</i>
										</p>
										<p>Since the study, Olivia shared the <a href="#">Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia</a> and apple cider vinegar combination with her close friend, Mark, who had also been struggling with his weight. Mark's results are even more impressive than Olivia.</p>

                                                    <strong>Mark lost over 130lbs in under 3 months with Olivia's help</strong></em> </p>
										</div>
										<br>
										<p>We sat down with Olivia to ask her more about how she found out about <a href="#">Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia</a> and whether or not that is all that she used to lose 37lbs so quickly.</p>
										<p><strong>CL:</strong> Tell us, how did you know where to start?</p>
										<p><i><strong>Olivia:</strong> To be honest, I really didn't. I was given a budget for the project by the university, and I spent nearly all of it researching everything under the sun. I looked into other previous research, case studies, and even successful weight loss stories of others.</i>
										</p>
										<div class="results" style="background: #EEE; border: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: center;"> <img width="608" height="342" src="images/bba.jpg"> </div>
										<p><strong>CL:</strong> Was it expensive to get <a href="#">Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia</a>?</p>
										<p><i><strong>Olivia:</strong> It actually was not very expensive at all, and thankfully so. By the time I had found out about Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia and apple cider vinegar, I had about $13 left in my project budget. Since Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia is a completely natural formula, the supplier doesn't spend a lot to manufacture it. Additionally, they actually provided me with a <a href="#">trial 1 month </a> and I just paid for shipping! So I got Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia for $5 and picked up a bottle of apple cider vinegar for $6 from a local grocery store, and I still had $2 left in my budget!</i>
										</p>
										<p><strong>CL:</strong> That's impressive! Could you explain how it works?</p>
										<p><i><strong>Olivia:</strong> There isn't much to it, and that is the appeal of it all. Every morning, I made tea with 1 - 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar and took Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia with it. Other than that, I didn't change a single thing in my daily routine. 30 days later, I am 37lbs off the waist and in better shape than ever before!</i>

										<p>1. Mix in a glass, 1-2 teaspoons of organic Apple Cider Vinegar with warm water.</p>

										<div class="results" style="clear:both;">
											<p class="bold">Week One:</p>
											<p> One week after combining Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia with apple cider vinegar every morning I was surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level was up, and I wasn't even hungry. A welcomed side effect of <a href="#" target="_blank">Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia</a> is its power to curb the appetite.</p>
											<p> Best of all, I didn't even change anything about my daily routine. On Day 7, I got on the scale and couldn't believe my eyes. I had lost 9.5lbs. But I still wasn't convinced, since they say you lose a lot of water weight at the beginning of any diet. I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks. </p>
											<p class="bold">Week Three:</p>
											<p> After 3 weeks, all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down 2 pant sizes after losing another 16.5lbs. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, around the third week of other diets, I would tend to run out of steam. But with <a href="#" target="_blank">Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia</a> my energy levels didn't dip, instead they remain steady throughout the day. </p>
											<p class="bold">Week Four:</p>
											<p> After the fourth week, my final results were shocking. I lost an unbelievable 37lbs since starting with apple cider vinegar and<a href="#" target="_blank">Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia</a>! I feel blessed to share this with other people who are struggling with their weight as well. Using Natures Trim Garcinia Cambogia in week 4, I lost an additional 11 lbs. </p>

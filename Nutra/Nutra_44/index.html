							<p><em><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>nstead of throwing away precious dollars on expensive creams that make big promises and don't work, one reader discovered&nbsp;<strong><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a skin product</a>&nbsp;that erased 10-15 years of wrinkles from her face in just minutes for free</strong>. Read on to find out how you can do the same...</em>
							</p><em>
<p>Kate, a 63 year-old grandma from Houston, Texas, is a perfect example of how a little smart thinking can help you&nbsp;<strong>look younger for less</strong>.</p>
<p>Like most women, Kate didn't have the extra cash to try out every celebrity endorsed anti-aging "miracle cream" out there, let alone splurge on ridiculously expensive things like plastic surgery or botox.</p>
<p>Before trying this simple trick, she admits to falling for several skin care gimmicks that gave her zero results. After wasting hours of her time, she was left with nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>Frustrated and let down, she considered going so far as to take out a loan for a pricey facelift procedure. But the high cost ($2000+) and the horror stories of unfixable procedures gone bad convinced her that those treatments were not the solution she was looking for.</p>
<h1>Kate's Solution:</h1>
<p>After a year of researching and speaking to other women about their own skincare habits, she learned of a product that produces real results and helps women take years off their skin:&nbsp;<strong><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Age Defy</a></strong>.</p>
<div>
<a class="outlink" href="#" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="images/agedefy.png" alt="med1"></a>
</div>
<p>After only a few days of adding&nbsp;<strong><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Age Defy</a></strong>&nbsp;to her daily skin routine, she saw instantly noticeable results in the mirror. After just two weeks the proof was staring her right in the face:&nbsp;<strong>this was giving her real results</strong>.</p>
<p>Using&nbsp;<strong><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Age Defy</a></strong>, Kate's results were nothing short of miraculous. This&nbsp;<strong>removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles</strong>&nbsp;and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck,&nbsp;<strong>removing all signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin</strong>. Kate was able to see these dramatic anti-aging results almost from the first application.</p>
<div>
<a class="outlink" href="#" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="images/katebefore.png" alt="med1"></a>
</div>
<p>Her friends, husband, and family have all commented on the difference it has made to Kate's confidence and looks. They were convinced she'd been secretly getting Botox, even deep wrinkles had begun to bounce back! Soon, word got around as her friends starting using Kate's method, and not long after,&nbsp;<strong>her easy discovery was featured on TV</strong>!</p>
<p>Kate is now one of hundreds of women that share the same incredible story.&nbsp;<strong>Using this method, she effectively erased 20+ years from her skin</strong>. It's changed her life and completely astonished everyone around her, even total strangers!</p>
<h1>What's The Secret?</h1>
<p>Through her research, Kate discovered that the real secret to&nbsp;<a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Age Defy</a>&nbsp;are these 2 key formulas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elastin Formula</li>
<li>Collagen Formula</li>
</ul>
<p>These formulas use all natural ingredients like Collagen-producing peptides, Stem Cell extracts, and natural fruit extracts that work together to&nbsp;<strong>erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level</strong>&nbsp;- below the surface of the skin - which is why they're so effective.</p>
<div>
<a class="outlink" href="#" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="images/socialproof2.png" alt="med1"></a>
</div>
<p>Some of the world’s most prestigious research universities have extensively studied breakthrough anti-aging formulas.</p>
<div>
<a class="outlink" href="#" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="images/first.jpg" alt="med1"></a>
</div>
<p><strong>The Collagen Formula</strong>&nbsp;is the key to maintaining healthy, youthful skin. It’s a powerful Botox-replacement formula rich in antioxidants like Argireline and natural fruit extracts. It slows the rate of free-radical damage and reverses any existing damage. Those evil free-radicals are what cause your skin dryness, fine lines, and wrinkles. It helps combat and even&nbsp;<strong>reverse time’s effect on your skin</strong>, because it forces your skin to produce collagen – a protein which tightens the skin from the inside out.</p>
<div>
<a class="outlink" href="#" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="images/second.jpg" alt="med1"></a>
</div>
<p><strong>The Elastin Formula</strong>&nbsp;works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper and moisturiser. This combo helps your skin&nbsp;<strong>repair and regenerate</strong>&nbsp;itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. Additionally, it also helps smooth-en any residual lines that are leftover.</p>
<p><strong>Basically, the combo works in two steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, by reducing and tightening wrinkles</li>
<li>Second, by smoothing &amp; filling in any residual wrinkles left over</li>
</ul>

<p>"It's simply amazing. I can't believe how quickly I saw results - Real results! I literally saw the difference after just 1 day. I can't thank you enough. I have my youthful face back!"</p>
<p><small>Jane from Los Angeles, California</small></p>
<p><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/doctor.jpg" align="left"></a>Dr. Richard Peters, a prominent dermatologist based in Beverly Hills, California, revealed to us that Age Defy is the celebrity secret to youthful skin because both products contain the purest and most powerful forms of skin tightening stem cells and peptides. Best of all the products are all-natural, perfectly safe for all skin types, and have no nasty side effects.</p>
<p>What the Collagen &amp; Elastin formulas do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new ones.&nbsp;<strong>Our tests show that you can erase almost 20 to 30 years off your face in less than 14 days</strong>. But the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they're not all the same.</p>
<h1>Kate's 14 Day Age Defy Results:</h1>
<p>"The trick is Age Defy contains high concentrations of stem cells and peptides in just the right concentrations. I also discovered that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants to help fight against aging; they prevent wrinkles from forming and remove existing ones too. The instructions were easy to follow but very specific: they're important to follow precisely because it does make a visible difference. You apply just a light coat of Age Defy on your face and neck after washing and drying your face, and gently pat before bed time. I saw results almost overnight, but after 14 days, the results were literally shocking. I looked how I used to look 20 years ago!" -<strong>Kate</strong></p>
<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/day1.jpg" align="left"></a> After the first day of using <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Age Defy</a>, I was shocked at the drastic results. The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes! I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!</p>
<p>I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face.</p>
<p>After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it.</p>
<h1>Day 5</h1>
<p><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/day5.jpg" align="left"></a>
</p><p>After five days of using&nbsp;<strong><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Age Defy</a></strong>&nbsp;I was shocked at the drastic results.</p>
<p>The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!</p>
<p>I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off! Not only did my skin look younger, it also felt younger.</p>
<p>Not only were the results amazing, they were incredibly easy to achieve, taking less than 15 minutes out of my day to apply the cream.</p>
<h1>Day 14</h1>
<p><a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="images/day15.jpg" align="left"></a>
</p><p>After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!</p>
<p>The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!</p>
<p>After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago.&nbsp;<strong>By this point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!</strong></p>
<h1>Will This Work For You?</h1>
<p><a class="outlink" href="#" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="images/agedefy.png" alt="neuro" width="150"></a> </p><p>All you have to do is try out this solution for 14 days.</p>
<p>But honestly, it won’t take that long before you see how amazing it is. Right after the first application, you’ll see your skin actually revitalize and lift itself, making you look irresistibly young and beautiful.</p>
<p>Even though this offer is incredibly affordable at less than $5, it comes with a 100% risk-free guarantee!</p>
<p><strong>So if you don’t love having the confidence, beauty, and radiance you did 10 or 20 years ago, you can simply return it, and go back to having the same skin you do today</strong>.</p>
<p>But when looking better than ever costs less than $5... why would you ever go back?</p>

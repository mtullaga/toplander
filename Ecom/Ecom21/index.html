						<p>We’ve all read the latest news titles: <strong>“DANGEROUS NEW VIRAL MUTATIONS ARE TAKING THE WORLD BY STORM!”</strong> </p>
						<p>This is not the common cold. It’s a dangerous new strain that can cause serious illness and even death. Some governments are trying to cover it up. But pandemics can’t stay hidden for long. </p>
						<p class="bold">Prevention And Limited Exposure Are Good Ways To Protect Your Family</p>
						<a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank"><img src="images/feverairport.jpg">
						</a>
						<p>Fever-detecting heat sensors are at all airports. One symptom of the new virus could be elevated body temperature. Even before you show any other symptoms. So, all international travelers must be checked. </p>
						<p>People who are sick might not even know it themselves. </p>
						<p><em>Old flu shots do nothing against the new viruses. They are developing too fast for us to keep up. Prevention and recognizing potential symptoms are the key.</em>
						</p>
						<p class="bold">But Now, You Can Get The Same Temperature-Sensing Tech Used By Health Professionals And The Governments </p>
						<a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank"><img src="images/doctor_dt.jpg">

						<h2>FeverPatrol Is Perfect For Families With Young Kids </h2>
						<p><em>Sarah G., a mother of three, told us her story: </em>
						</p>
						<p>One day, my baby caught a bad cold, and she was crying, up all night, and had a fever. </p>
						<p>The pediatrician told me there was nothing to worry about, but he asked me to <strong>monitor her temperature and call him if it started to rise.</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The only thermometer I had was one of those old-fashioned glass ones that you had to shake and put in your mouth. </p>
						<p>I couldn’t do that with the baby, so the <strong>only choice was to put it in her armpit, or use it rectally</strong>, which I absolutely didn’t want to do. </p>
						<p>It made me nervous to take my child’s temperature. <strong>She started to cry and squirm around when I tried to take her temperature under her armpit</strong>. </p>
						<p><strong>I didn’t want to spread germs with the thermometer</strong>, so I sterilized the thermometer with alcohol each time I wanted to take her temperature. </p>
						<div class="column-5-left">
							<a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank"><img src="images/cryingbaby.jpg">
							</a>
						</div>
						<p>It was even worse at night. Finally, after crying and sneezing, she would fall asleep, but I was worried that she was too hot, so I tried to take her temperature again after a few hours. </p>
						<p>This immediately woke my baby up, and then it was another hour of crying before she went back to sleep. I was totally frustrated and exhausted </p>
						<h2>A Nurse Recommended This Wonderful Device </h2>
						<p>The next day, I called my pediatrician and spoke to the nurse. I told her about my problems with the old-fashioned thermometer. </p>
						<p><strong>“Oh my goodness!”</strong> she said. <strong>“Don’t you know about <a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank"><strong>FeverPatrol</strong>
							</a>?”</strong>
						</p>
						<p><strong>“<strong>FeverPatrol</strong>?”</strong> I said, <strong>“No, what’s that?”</strong> </p>
						<p>She told me that <a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank"><strong>FeverPatrol</strong></a> was a <strong>super-accurate, easy-to-use non-contact thermometer.</strong> </p>
						<p>She told me to come into the doctor’s office and they would lend me one to try. </p>
						<p>I took my baby’s temperature several times during the day, and <strong>there was no squirming and crying.</strong> </p>
						<div class="column-5-right">
							<a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank"><img src="images/thermometer_baby.jpg">
							</a>
						</div>
						<p>And that night, <strong>I easily took her temperature while she was sleeping</strong>. She didn’t even know I was doing it, and of course, she didn’t wake up. </p>
						<p>I had to get one. If you have kids or if you need a thermometer for yourself, this is fantastic! </p>
						<h2>I Bought My Own FeverPatrol Thermometer </h2>
						<p>When I returned <a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank"><strong>FeverPatrol</strong></a> the next week (My baby was already 100% better!), I asked her where to get one. She searched on my phone and showed me the <a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank">official website here</a>, so I could order one for myself. </p>
						<p>Here’s my experience: </p>
						<div class="unordered-list-wrapper">
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Shipping was fast</strong> and I got it in the mail sooner than I expected. </li>
								<li><strong>It was so easy to use</strong>. I put in the batteries and it was ready to use in a few seconds. </li>
								<li>First, I took my own temperature with the old-fashioned oral thermometer, then I took it with the <strong>FeverPatrol</strong>. <strong>The <strong>FeverPatrol</strong> was 100% accurate. </strong>
								</li>
								<li>I was so happy. Now I had an <strong>accurate, professional thermometer.</strong> </li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>Of course, I never wanted my kids to be sick, but I felt better knowing I was prepared for an emergency. And a few weeks later, my hubby had a cold, and he really liked the convenience of <strong>FeverPatrol</strong> too! </p>
						<p>It is essential for every home! </p>
						<h2>FeverPatrol Gets Accurate Readings On Anything! </h2>

                <p>I hate mosquitoes! The bites. The buzzing. Scratches. Swelling.</p>
                <p>They ruin my summers every year...</p>

                <p>When I think of fun summer activities like camping, enjoying family meals on the terrace, BBQ with friends, <strong>I get anxiety and itchiness</strong> just thinking about those mosquitoes. I'm like a magnet for those animals. Every summer I would be covered with dozens of <strong>red welts and have terrible swelling.</strong> Not to mention the itch! </p>
                <p>I tried everything. DEET sprays, lotions, those anti-bug candles,...</p>
                <p>NOTHING proved to be 100% effective.</p>
                <p>Those special <strong>bug repellent candles and sprays</strong> smell awful. Some even contain <strong>toxic chemicals</strong>. These are so unhealthy that some have been BANNED in many countries. Mosquitoes are also evolving and becoming RESILIENT to the poisons and repellents. The worst part? The sprays didn't even work when my granddaughter used them! I feel so sorry for the poor child.</p>
				<div class="text-center">

				</div>
                <center><em>That mosquito spray with DEET was of no use at all.</em></center>
                <hr>
                <p>I thought I would never be able to get rid of the sleepless summer nights and painful itchness. But then I was sent this new bug zapper to test and review.</p>
                <p>This <a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank">new bug zapper</a> is <strong>selling like crazy</strong> and the demand surprised everyone. The device is <strong>very portable, ultra safe and kills annoying insects fast</strong>.</p>				
				
				<h2>What Is It?</h2>
                <p>It's called <strong><a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank">Buzz B-Gone</a></strong>.</p>
				<!--<div class="text-center">
					<a href="https://grallight-nisual.com/click" class="ctaLink" target="_blank">
							<img src="images/zapper.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="main" />
						</a>
				</div>
                <br />-->
                <p>The device was designed by two engineers who were fed up with being bitten whilst camping. They found that traditional anti-mosquito devices were either using toxic chemicals, using dangerous high voltages or simply didn't work.</p>
                <p>That's why they designed this new genius device:</p>
                <div class="text-center">
					<a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank">
							<img src="images/genius.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="main">
						</a>
				</div>
                <br>
                
                <p>It's a brand new type of bug catcher.</p>
                <p><strong>Finally there is an alternative to harmful insect repellent that you apply to your skin.</strong></p>
                <p>People are using this device to <strong>live 'mosquito free'</strong> and the results are amazing.</p>
				<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
                <div class="text-center">
					<a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank">
							<img src="images/tech.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="main">
						</a>
				</div>
                <hr>
                
                <p>The patented design is both innovative and very effective.</p>
                <p>Instead of trying to keep the mosquitoes away or zapping them with high voltage, it actually attracts, catches and kills them!</p>
                <p><a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank"><strong>Buzz B-Gone</strong></a> uses UV light to attract insects. <strong>A quiet suction fan and a 1-way trapdoor keep them trapped</strong>. The bugs will be <strong>air-dried to die</strong> in just under 2 minutes (<em>they quickly die without moisture</em>). </p>
                <p>Once trapped in the drying basket, you can simply empty the basket into the trash. You don't even have to touch them.</p>
                <p>It's powered by a <strong>USB</strong> connection. The low voltage makes it perfectly safe for children and pets. </p>
                <p>And it's very portable! You can even plug it into a power bank and take it with you when you go camping!</p>
                <p>No need for chemicals or batteries. It's also very silent when operating.</p>
                 <h2>Here's My Personal Experience With This Device</h2>
                                <p>I connected my <a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank">Buzz B-Gone</a> to a USB powerbank so I could use it outdoors. I was hoping my grandchildren were no longer going to be eaten alive when they visited us.</p>

                <p>As soon as I saw the mosquitoes come close to the device, those little monsters got <strong>sucked into the trap and were getting destroyed!</strong>!</p>
                 <p><strong>I catched a lot of mosquitoes after just ONLY ONE NIGHT: </strong></p>

                <div class="text-center">
                                    <a href="#" class="ctaLink" target="_blank">
                                            <img src="images/image4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="main">
                                        </a>
                                </div>
                <hr>
                <p>The results speak for themselves.</p>
                                <p>On hot summerdays, <strong>my house is also filled with flies</strong>. I love this device because it traps and kills those annoying insects in minutes.</p>

                <h2>Key Buzz B-Gone Features, Facts, and Benefits:</h2>

                <h3>✅ Safe For Pets And Children</h3>
                    <p>The device works on a low voltage, making it safe to use. It doesn't make dogs or cats nervous.</p>

                <h3>✅ Very Portable</h3>
                    <p>The device is small enough to carry with you while camping or in your luggage when you are taking a flight. If you want to use it while camping, a simple USB powerbank is all you need to enjoy a full night of usage.</p>
                
                <h3>✅ No Chemicals</h3>
                    <p>It does not use any chemicals like DEET. This means less exposure to toxicity, no greasy feel and no smells. Perfect for people sensitive to skin allergy or pregnant ladies.</p>
                <h3>✅ Easy To Clean</h3>
                    <p>Cleaning is fast and easy.</p>

               <h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
                <p>It's now discounted down to <strong style="color:green;">$59</strong> (retails at $92), which might seem expensive at first. But when you consider most other devices need expensive refills or can be harmful to pets or kids, this is actually a pretty good deal.

                <p>And it just works.</p>

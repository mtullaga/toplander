									<p><em>"I looked at smartwatches from all the other big brands. They seemed good, but I just couldn't afford them. Decided to go for this after a friend recommended it. No regrets.

								<div class="quote">
									<p><em>"I have always worn a watch, but I am getting fit this year and wanted all the health and fitness monitoring stuff a smartwatch does. I can't stand the look of normal smartwatches. This <a class="ctaLink" href="#">LoyalWatch</a> was slightly cheaper, looks 100x better than others and seemed to do all the same stuff, plus the heart monitoring alarms. What can i say? it works perfectly and looks amazing. What a crazy bargain at under <span class="cur"></span>200"</em> - Brody L.</p>

									<p><em>"Came in just over a week. The <a class="ctaLink" href="#">LoyalWatch</a> is brilliant. Very comfortable, excellent workmanship and also looks good!

								<h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
								<p>If you look at the features of the <a class="ctaLink" href="#">LoyalWatch</a> it wouldn’t be surprising to see a price tag of up to $500. Which would still be lower than most of its competitors (some cost over $1,000).</p>
								<p>That’s why we were stunned to learn the company sells this watch for just <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;" class="discount">$49</span> (thanks to a 50% promo ending soon).</p>
								<p> <a class="ctaLink" href="#">Click here to claim a discounted </a><a class="ctaLink" href="#">LoyalWatch</a> (if it's still available) &gt;&gt;
								</p>
								<p> That's a small price to pay, for a 24/7 heart rate monitor device!</p>

								<p>Since <a class="ctaLink" href="#">LoyalWatch</a> is a direct-to-consumer brand, they spend no money on advertising.</p>
								<p>They also only sell online so they can cut out any middle-men (like retailers) who just jack up the prices the consumer pays.</p>
								<p>When you buy from a big brand, you aren’t only paying for the product, you are paying for all the enormous costs they have as a company.</p>
								<p> You’re helping to pay their rent, their CEO’s salary, their advertising cost, etc.</p>

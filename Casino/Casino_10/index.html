					<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter years of being buried in soul-crushing debt Richard Lustig won the lotto not just 5 times but a total of <a target="_blank" href="#"><b>7 times in the last two years.</b></a>
					</p>
					<p>You see, I was neighbors with Richard for the last 10 years. He was a good neighbor but for the last two years I could tell something was different...</p>
					<p>All the sudden he was home a lot more, he was driving nicer cars and wearing very nice clothing. Next thing you know they sold their house. What the hell was going on I thought...</p>
					<p>When Richard was moving out, I offered to take a load over to their new house since I had an old pickup truck.</p>
					<p>We pulled up to his new house and <b>this is what I saw:</b>
					</p>
					<p> <img src="images/image05.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3826079720"> </p>
					<p>I couldn’t believe Richard was moving here!</p>
					<p>After unloading the truck I asked him how he was able to afford this epic house and what he told me blew my mind.</p>
					<p>“I won the lotto 7 times in the last two years”</p>
					<p><b>7 times!</b> That month Richard hit the <b>biggest jackpot of his life</b> and his life changed forever.</p>
					<p>He decided to teach me <a target="_blank" href="#">the very same system responsible for his lottery winnings</a>.</p>
					<p>Even though I was standing in his multimillion dollar house, paid for with lotto money I was still skeptical.</p>
					<p>My wife told me I was “crazy” for playing the lotto. Until...</p>
					<p><b>I WON my FIRST lotto for $124,140!</b>
					</p>
					<p>Then my SECOND and THIRD jackpot in just under six months.</p>
					<p>My total earnings in the <i>first six months?</i>
					</p>
					<p><b>$1,242,012!!!</b>
					</p>
					<p>With my earnings I paid off my debt and moved my family in right next door to Richard</p>
					<p><img src="images/image06.jpg" class="img-responsive" data-pagespeed-url-hash="4120579641"> </p>
					<p>I finally convinced Richard to create <a target="_blank" href="#">put a video on YouTube</a> to share this with other people. After uploading the video to YouTube something strange happened...</p>
					<p>The video kept getting removed for “Copyright” claims by the state lotto commission. They desperately did not want Richard’s system available for the public to use.</p>
					<p>So we decided to put that video on a private website where it couldn’t get taken down.</p>
					<p>You can <a target="_blank" href="#">watch that video</a> where Richard breaks down his secret formula. He will cover his six steps to the system.</p>

					<p>Richard, I’m just writing this quick note to thank you for changing my life, this month i’ve already hit the lotto three times, for $13,200, $120,182 and $38,492.</p>
					<p>Some months aren’t quite as crazy as this, but regardless I’ve been averaging around $22,000 per month and it’s all thanks to your system. I still just can’t believe how easy it is to use.</p>
					<p>I’m glad you’re not going to share this with too many people because I think the lottery would go out of business!</p>

					<p><strong>Ricky W, Palm Beach, Florida</strong>
					</p>
					<p>I can’t believe it, 5 win’s of $5,00 or more over the last three months!!!</p>
					<p>If you told me a few months ago that I’d be winning like this, I would have said you were crazy! But your formula is so easy to use and it’s so insanely accurate, now I know that me and my family will be financially set for life.</p>

					<p><strong>Dennis R, Redlands, California</strong>
					</p>
					<p>When a friend of mine shared your website with me I thought he must be nuts. There’s no system to beat the lottery I told him.</p>
					<p>But after watching him hit his 3rd jackpot in six months for a total of $1,242,002 in winnings, I started to think maybe he wasn’t so crazy after all.</p>
					<p>So I gave this a try and my god I am happy that I did. I just hit my first jackpot for $124,120 and it’s only been about 29 days. I can’t wait to keep winning</p>

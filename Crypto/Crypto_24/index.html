                                    had to let most of their staff go. Sumati lost her job and the couple were about to

                                    In March things at the airline were so bad a lot of flights were cancelled due to the global crisis. It was a very emotional time for most of us. We didn’t know what would happen until they let most of us go.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My husband thought that we wouldn’t survive financially because nobody would go on holidays or business trips for the near future  in these scary times.

                                    “I signed a contract to go to work as a cleaner. It didn’t pay much but it was better than not earning anything. It was hard working  as a cleaner after my job as a flight attendant for Indian Airlines while my husband was at home with our kid. I missed travelling and my friends at Indian Airlines , but I had no choice. Up to that point I worked as a flight attendant and had no idea what was waiting for me as a cleaner.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The good thing was they were in need of workers, so I managed to get a job as soon as I arrived there. First couple of weeks were hard but the thought of my family kept me going and nothing would stop me from earning my wages.

                                </p>

                                    I knew that just my paycheck wouldn’t be enough to get us out of financial trouble and I was determined to find a way to get us out of debt. I needed more money than my job was paying.

                                    I spent my spare time browsing various Facebook groups looking for job offers when I came across advice on how to make money online through
                                    <a href="#">Bitcoin Bank</a>. I was never a math girl but it seemed simple enough, so I decided to give it a try.

                                    After a quick tutorial I took ₹ 16,500  and made my investment. I was nervous but was relieved after I earned back my investment and made an extra ₹ 37,000. I quickly clicked the withdraw button, to transfer the money to my bank account, so I don’t lose it. Within two hours the money was in my account.

                                    In the next few months profit just poured in, it was the most exciting period of my life. After 4 months my account was at ₹ 21,851,390.  I’ll never forget after 9 months I hit ₹ 75,000,000. My co-workers knew nothing about it and hadn’t  even told my husband.

                                    I finally told my husband all about it, he couldn’t believe it. He actually made me go to the bank to withdraw ₹ 748,335 to prove I wasn’t fooling him. It was at that point he believed we weren’t poor anymore.

                                    I went and bought a new car, put down a deposit for our new house in Mumbai and finally paid off our debt. Finally, everything fell into place.

                                    What you do need to know is that you can simply start by transferring as little
                                    as ₹ 16,500 to a 100% safe and free brokerage-account and rake in profits with the click of your mouse.

                                    There is no maximum. High-net-worth individuals could deposit ₹ 75 million,
                                    ₹ 300 million  or even ₹ 750 million. And they could all see the value of that account grow within hours...

                                    Anyone can learn to master this in no time. You don’t need
                                    any prior investing experience or business background. You don’t need a
                                    college degree. You don’t need to be good at math either. There is no
                                    hard work involved and there is nothing to sell. You won’t have to give
                                    up control or follow difficult guidelines.
                                    There is no guesswork or ‘luck’ required. Once you get going, it only
                                    takes a few hours a week to do everything.
                                    And you can do it all at home, or wherever you want, while you’re doing
                                    other things, too!

                                    Here’s what’s even more astounding: when a normal stock or
                                    share gains a measly 10%, a ‘Bitcoin Bank’ could return 10, 50 or even 200 times
                                    more! Amazing isn't it?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That is an average of 44x your money! That’s enough to turn every ₹ 16,500 into ₹ 1,923,970... And every ₹ 37,000  into  ₹ 4,303,670....

                                    Before we continue we have to warn you. The financial elite are deathly afraid more Indians are jumping on this. It’s already pissed off several very powerful banks. Big brokerage firms are out for blood because they're losing millions and together with the governments they will do everything within their powers to BAN this method from the ordinary Indians residents and prevent more ‘working-class’ citizens from getting rich.

He is a 42 year old father and lives in Mumbai together with his wife. As an electrician he has always been able to pay the bills, but was never able to take his family on a well deserved holiday. And without having any computer skills, degrees or knowledge about how the financial markets work he would be our perfect fit for the test.

                                        On day two, I woke up and rushed to work. I had slept in and was going to be late. When I got to work, I checked my emails and drank my coffee. Then, I remembered, I forgot to check my trade! It was already 10:45am, so it had been almost 12 hours since I placed it. I logged into the site, feeling nervous and excited. Would my funds still be there? I felt a little anxious…

                                        I opened the dashboard of the site. I thought at first I had made a mistake. Was this my account? I double checked the account name in the corner, yes it was mine. At that point, I almost spilled my coffee! I could see that my new balance at that time was  ₹ 91,596  Incredible! In only 12 hours, while I was sleeping, the account made ₹ 75,132 profit from the ₹ 16,500 that I had funded. I’m glad I remembered to make a screenshot of it, so you can see below what I saw that morning. I wrote to my account personal mentor. Amazingly, he was not as surprised as I was. “This is normal” he said, “in fact, we often see people earning more than that in the first 12 hours”. I was impressed, this thing was really working. For the rest of the day, I could hardly concentrate on my job.

When I told him I got access to Bitcoin Bank he told me I wasn't the first one who made huge sums of cash using this and invited me to talk about investment opportunities.

                                                        home.. I'm going to give this a shot if its still possible.

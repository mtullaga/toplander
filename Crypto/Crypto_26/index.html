							<p><i>Carl Reznor, a financial analyst at a major bank, explains why anyone, even someone who’s poor, can and should invest. In this article, he talks about the main types of investments and presents a unique test that determines which of these types is right for you. Find out how much and how quickly you can earn using what you have in your wallet or on your bank card</i>
							</p> <img src="images/text-photo-1.jpg" alt="photo">
							<h2 class="title">He who is not investing is losing money</h2>
							<p>To start, let's think: what do you usually do with the money you earn? It seems as if there are only two options: it can be spent or saved. I don’t think it’s worth it to teach you how to spend money. Or how to save either. I’d like to talk about a third option, which most people forget for some reason.</p>
							<p>I'm talking about investments: financial investments that over time bring in passive income as interest on the amount invested. In short, it looks like this: you invest your money in a certain type of investment and after a certain period of time you withdraw it along with the interest. Depending on the type of investment, the rate of return can be 5%, 10%, 15%, and in some cases 100%, 200%, and even higher.</p>
							<div class="inset">
								<p><i>Strangely enough, only 5% of the world's population is investing. Every time I become aware of this fact, I feel queasy. Just think of how much money people lose by not knowing or understanding investment tools. I say “lose” because this is another quite surprising fact for many people!</i>
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>I hope you know about inflation. Thanks to constantly growing inflation, your money depreciates over time. $100 will equal $98 or even $80 after a year – it all depends on the inflation rate.</p>
							<p>What can you do to keep your hard-earned money? My answer: invest. The main thing is to determine where. It all depends on the amount of money you have and other factors, which I’ll discuss below. For example, I earn money by <a href="#" target="">trading</a>. In this case, the rate of return is 80% to 92% of the amount invested, and you can withdraw the earned profit within a period of one to five days.</p>
							<h2 class="title">Where you can invest your money</h2>
							<p><b>1. Bank deposit</b>
							</p>
							<ul class="invest-list">
								<li>Starting amount: depends on the bank, but usually at least $1,000</li>
								<li>Yield: depends on the bank, but no more than 5%</li>
								<li>Problems and risks: unable to withdraw money before 6 months</li>
								<li>Profit waiting period: at least 6 months</li>
								<li>Summary: this a stable type of investment with a low yield and a relatively long period for making a profit.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>2. Foreign currency</b>
							</p>
							<ul class="invest-list">
								<li>Starting amount: any, but it’s more profitable to invest more</li>
								<li>Yield: depends on exchange rate fluctuations, but as a rule, no more than 5-10%</li>
								<li>Problems and risks: you can go into a serious deficit if the currency loses value, and a sizable profit can be made only if you buy currency in large amounts (at least $10,000)</li>
								<li>Profit waiting period: unknown, depends on exchange rate fluctuations</li>
								<li>Summary: an unstable type of investment with income that depends on the size of the initial amount, high risks, and an unpredictable period for making a profit.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>3. Real estate</b>
							</p>
							<ul class="invest-list">
								<li>Starting amount: depends on the type of real estate, but as a rule, at least $10,000</li>
								<li>Yield: depends on the type of real estate, but as a rule, 15-20%</li>
								<li>Problems and risks: real estate needs to be cared for and maintained in good condition. There is the chance it may be lost due to natural disasters or other force majeure</li>
								<li>Profit waiting period: depends on the type of real estate, but as a rule, 10-20 years</li>
								<li>Summary: a relatively stable type of investment with an average yield and a very long period for making a profit.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>4. Cryptocurrency</b>
							</p>
							<ul class="invest-list">
								<li>Starting amount: any, but it’s more profitable to invest more</li>

								<li>Profit waiting period: unknown, depends on exchange rate fluctuations</li>
								<li>Summary: an unstable type of investment with income that depends on the size of the initial amount, high risks, and an unpredictable period for making a profit.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>5. Your own business</b>
							</p>
							<ul class="invest-list">
								<li>Starting amount: depends on the area of ​​business, but usually at least $1,000</li>
								<li>Yield: depends on the area of business, as well as the investor’s knowledge and personal traits</li>
								<li>Problems and risks: it’s difficult to forecast the result, the business may go bust</li>
								<li>Profit waiting period: depends on the area of ​​business, but usually at least 2-3 years</li>
								<li>Summary: an unstable type of investment with income that depends on the chosen field and the investor’s personal traits, with high risks and many pitfalls.</li>

							<p><b>6. Trading</b>
							</p>
							<ul class="invest-list">
								<li>Starting amount: any, but it’s more profitable to invest more</li>

								</li>
								<li>Problems and risks: you need at least a minimum understanding of trading</li>
								<li>Profit waiting period: at least a few minutes</li>
								<li>Summary: a type of investment with a sufficiently high income and a fast period for making a profit</li>
							</ul>
							<h2 class="title">Want an income of 5% per year or 80% from each successful trade today? Only you can decide</h2>
							<p>As you can see, the investment types depend only on your desires and abilities. Do you want a stable but small income to cover your losses from inflation? Then put your money into a savings account. But be prepared: you have to wait half a year to withdraw it. If you think that life is fairly unpredictable and you might need money at any moment, then it’s obvious that this option isn’t for you.</p>
							<p>It’s entirely possible that you’re a big adventurer and ready to take risks on buying/selling currencies. Of course, I don’t see why you shouldn’t. Just be prepared that one day the exchange rate may soar and you’ll either earn your 10-20% yield or lose and not recover your money. It’s very possible that any cryptocurrency trades in your country will be made illegal, and then your accounts will be disabled and you may even be arrested. Yes, this happens. Serious money means serious risks. I’ve warned you.</p> <img src="images/text-photo-2.jpg" alt="photo">
							<p>Who knows, maybe you decide to buy a home outside the city and, however you look at it, it’s a profitable investment. Real estate always rises in value, and in this case you can settle there or pass it on to your children and grandchildren. Except a nice country home requires serious money both for the purchase and for maintenance. So, bear in mind the additional money needed for maintenance repairs, utilities, and annual insurance against natural disasters and theft. Who knows, maybe in a couple of years, instead of a cozy bedroom community, you’ll have a newly formed ghetto with a nearby nuclear power plant. Anything is possible in this life.</p>
							<div class="inset">
								<p><i>If you ask me which method of earning money I prefer, I’d definitely say <a href="#" target="">trading</a>. Because it’s an opportunity to get 80% to 92% of the invested amount today. Of course, first you have to practice a little to understand how it all works. Here is your main desire; everything else will follow</i>
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>In general, no matter what anyone says, in this life you decide everything yourself, and both the choice and the responsibility always lie only with you. One person takes risks and earns big money, another person prefers to be content with small but stable income. To each his own. I have prepared and suggest taking a simple test to identify which type of investment is right for you. The result will really surprise you ;)</p>
							<h2 class="title">What type of investment is right for you</h2>
							<div class="calc-container"></div>
							<h2 class="title">Try being a trader</h2>
							<p>I recommend that all beginners start with practice trades on <a href="#" target="">Olymp Trade</a>. I’m confident that you’ll master the mechanics and understand how everything works.</p>
							<div class="banner-container"></div>
							<div class="cta"> <a href="#" class="big-blue-link" target="_blank">Start earning money on a live account</a> </div>
							<h2 class="title">"You don’t have to work if your money works for you”</h2>
							<p>This is my favorite quote and it applies to trading. As an established banking advisor, I should tell you that the least risky option is to deposit money into a bank account. However, as an unencumbered trader, I understand that this is far from the most profitable type of investment: interest on a deposit will save you from inflation, but it won’t allow you to earn money. If we’re talking about my favorite way to earn money, then it’s definitely <a href="#" target="">trading</a>. Money must be in circulation, not lying in an account like dead weight. I’ll tell you how I came to this conclusion.</p> <img src="images/text-photo-3.jpg" alt="photo">
							<p>For 15 years I have worked as a lead analyst at a major bank, where I started from the bottom as a teller. Can I claim that I know everything about finance? Of course not. However, I know more about financial matters than anyone you know. Judge for yourself: I work with VIP clients who come to me with questions about where it’s more profitable to invest tens and sometimes even hundreds of millions of dollars. I have practically no room for error in such a situation.</p>
							<div class="inset">
								<p><i>Before that, I worked with owners of medium and small businesses, and before that with ordinary people like you. They both also asked me where to invest their oftentimes very small amounts of money. I always gave the same answer – start trading</i>
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>This is because I’ve studied and tried all possible types of investments myself. I’m confident that the "classic" methods along the lines of buying stocks, real estate, or gold are suitable only for those who have a lot of savings. I'm not talking about hundreds or even thousands of dollars. I recommend that the vast majority of those who consider themselves to be middle class or lower to earn money by trading because in this case you can start earning money with any amount, even $10. Furthermore, I know that you don’t want to, which means you don’t have to wait several years to receive your dividends.</p>
							<div class="inset">
								<p><i>When trading, you can get a return every day through an ordinary transfer to a bank card. You agree that this is much more convenient than waiting 10 years and getting only 20% of the amount. Plus, by choosing the right broker, you can earn 80% to 92% on each successful trade.</i>
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>And if there are recommendations for choosing a broker, I recommend <a href="#" target="">Olymp Trade</a>. For five years I have been trading on their platform and strongly recommend it to my clients, many of whom now earn as much as I do, if not more. </p>
							<p>Here, look. This results table for the traders' tournament shows a couple of my clients who I introduced to trading.</p>

    <b>How do you start earning money?</b>
</h3>
							<p>Open an account with the broker <a href="#" target="_blank">by clicking here</a>.
								<br>Take the tutorial, which tells you about your account’s capabilities.</p>
							<p class="strong"><b>Now, the best part is a proven earning strategy that works</b>
							</p>
							<p>I recommend starting with an “up-down” strategy, as it doesn’t require serious immersion in trading and even beginners can use it.</p>
							<p class="strong"><b>Step 1. Choose a currency pair</b>
							</p>
							<p class="align-right">As a rule, EUR/USD works well.</p>
							<p class="strong"><b>Step 2. Set the time to 1 minute and the amount to $1</b>
							</p>
							<p class="align-right">If you want to earn more, then make a higher bet. However, I’ll explain the strategy by using this particular minimum bet as an example.</p>
							<p class="strong"><b>Step 3. Start trading</b>
							</p>
							<p class="align-right">Everything here is simple – you have to predict whether the exchange rate will <span class="green green_dark">rise</span> or <span class="red">fall</span> within 1 minute after opening a trade. Remember that you can make any forecast with this strategy – it doesn’t matter whether you choose <span class="green">UP</span> or <span class="red">DOWN</span>.</p>
							<p class="strong"><b>Let’s say that you’ve chosen <span class="green">UP</span></b>
							</p>
							<ul class="align-right align-right_long">
								<li>
									<p>If the chart actually goes up, <b>$1.82</b> will be returned to your account, having made 82 cents in profit</p>
									<p>Then you need to make your next trade, but this time you should choose the opposite value — <span class="red">DOWN</span>. Of course, you can bet with a larger amount if you want to earn more.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>If the chart goes the other way (down), then your trade was unsuccessful</p>
									<p>This means that you need to raise your next trade to $3 and change the direction of the chart again. So, if your last choice was <span class="red">DOWN</span>, now you need to choose <span class="green">UP</span>.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>If the chart didn’t go the way you wanted again, then you lose this trade</p>
									<p>But don’t worry. You have nothing to worry about because with this strategy you always make up for all losses. To recoup your losses and make a profit, increase the trade amount to $8 (without changing the trade time) and choose <span class="red">DOWN</span>.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p><i>Excellent! You chose the right direction and received $14.56. You not only made up for the loss, but also went into the black by making a profit. Now go back to trading and make a new bet, but this time you need to choose UP. Yes, that’s why it’s called the up-down strategy ;)</i>
							</p>
							<p class="strong"><b>Important point</b>
							</p>
							<p>Always change the direction of trades regardless of whether or not your bid was successful. If you want to test your strength, then start with a minimum bet of $1. If you lose, increase the amount to $3. If you lose again, change it to $8. If this happens again, increase the amount to $18. And don’t worry, I’ve personally never had to do this, even though I trade every day. Once a trade is successful, return to the first step and start again. The amount of the bet can be increased because this strategy works for any amount. And don’t forget: the bigger the bet, the bigger the profit!</p>
